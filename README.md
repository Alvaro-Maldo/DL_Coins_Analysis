# Coins images classification using Deep Learnig


Collecting is a broad market which extends to many products, one particular one is the coins collecting, where you can find that one "fiat" coin could be worth 100 times more. Manufacturing defects, antiquity or symbolic creation batchs are one many features collectors value and that are one of the reasons why they are so scarce. 

In the EU, each coin is represented by the indicative value of itself (1€, 2€..) and, on the other side, it is shown a symbol referring to the country where it has been manufactured, but this is not always true. And that are the Conmemorative coins.

A Conmemmorative coin is an special coin a EU country manufactures with the purpose to celebrate or recognise an important event in its history, they have normally low manufacturing batches and, for this reason, some of them are really valued in the market.

On this point is when we want to make a contribution to the society, by creating an algorithm that can show us, by a photo taken to a coin, if this coin is conmemorative and provinding some details about it.

## Data Collection and Selection

We will try to focus into a model that can determine with enough precision between 4 coins images. The ones that we are going to differentiate are 4 "2 euro" coins, 3 Conmemorative and 1 "national" coin.

Our first approach will be to obtain as much images we can in order to train the model as much as possible, and this is when one of the difficulties comes up. When talking about Conmemorative coins,
